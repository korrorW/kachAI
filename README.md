## WARNING
#### Main Warning
This was made for Education purposes only.
#### if Setup fails
The main issue with some people who aren't knowledgable in those aspects is that they don't download gitbash to use the git clone command and they sometimes have problems with pip and python, I recommend this
Python Version: 3.10.5
pip Version: 22.0.4
Gitbash
#### if you aren't on Windows
the issue might be this, use python3 instead of python or pip3 instead of pip
